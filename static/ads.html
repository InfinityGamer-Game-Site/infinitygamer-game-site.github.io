    <h3>Hi Google AdSense Reviewer!</h3>
    <p>My site keeps getting marked as unoriginal content or low value content, but it is not. <br>This game site is different than most, because I have made some of the games on here, and it offers many more tools, like cloaking, downloading all game saves as one file, and lots of customization. I have many users so it is of value to those users.</p>
